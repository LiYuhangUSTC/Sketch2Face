# Sketch2Face

Work in progress...

This is the official implementation of paper **DeepFacePencil: Creating Face Images from Freehand Sketches**. [arXiv Link](arXiv Link) [Project](https://liyuhangustc.github.io/Sketch2Face/)

### Prerequisites
PyTorch 1.6, Python 3.7, NumPy, scipy, PIL, tqdm

### Data
We use [CelebAMask-HQ](https://github.com/switchablenorms/CelebAMask-HQ) to obtain synthesized (boundary) sketches. Deformed sketches are generated by vectorizing synthesized sketches using [AutoTrace](http://autotrace.sourceforge.net/) and adding random offsets to endpoints and control points of vectorized strokes.

### Pretrained model
[GoogleDrive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Oga57eTNEIbuxV6L9GxGYv9fyIEdcBCD?usp=sharing)

### Test
The test sketches should be put in folder `./datasets/CelebAMask/test_A`. The pretrained model should be put in folder `./checkpoints/pretrained`. Example script of testing can be found in `./test_scripts.sh`. The results are supposed to be in `./results`.
